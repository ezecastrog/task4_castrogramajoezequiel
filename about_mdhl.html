              <h3>General Information</h3>
              <p>
                The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to
                provide athletes residing <br />
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to
                learn and play hockey. To be a <br />
                member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and
                reside a Chicago northside <br />
                neighborhood. MDHL ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on
                the generous volunteer time of <br />
                parents and previous league members
